    "本引言的标题就已经反映了我们自己的选择： a book that helps scientists–especially health and social scientists–generate and analyze data to make causal inferences that are explicit about both the causal question and the assumptions underlying the data analysis.（为什么作出这样一个选择？） Unfortunately, the scientific literature is plagued by studies in which the causal question is not explicitly stated and the investigators’ unverifiable assumptions are not declared. This casual attitude towards causal inference has led to a great deal of confusion. For example, it is not uncommon to find studies in which the effect estimates are hard to interpret because the data analysis methods cannot appropriately answer the causal question (were it explicitly stated) under the investigators’ assumptions (were they declared)."

    "在这本书中，we stress the need to take the causal question seriously enough to articulate it, and to delineate the separate roles of data and assumptions for causal inference. Once these foundations are in place, causal inferences become necessarily less casual, which helps prevent confusion. The book describes various data analysis approaches that can be used to estimate the causal effect of interest under a particular set of assumptions when data are collected on each individual in a population. 这本书的一个关键信息是，因果推理不能简化为用于数据分析的配方的集合。具体来说，就是像 DoWhy 的设计理念一样，把因果推断分成四个步骤：\n",

    "（本书的组织结构）The book is divided in three parts of increasing difficulty: Part I is about causal inference without models (i.e., nonparametric identification of causal ef- fects), Part II is about causal inference with models (i.e., estimation of causal effects with parametric models), and Part III is about causal inference from complex longitudinal data (i.e., estimation of causal effects of time-varying treatments). （我们全书使用 Fine Points 和 Technical points 来附加解释相关内容）Throughout the text, we have interspersed Fine Points and Technical points that elaborate on certain topics mentioned in the main text. Fine Points are designed to be accessible to all readers while Technical Points are designed for readers with intermediate training in statistics. The book provides a cohesive presentation of concepts of, and methods for, causal inference that are currently scattered across journals in several disciplines. （我们的目标读者是：）We expect that the book will be of interest to anyone interested in causal inference, e.g., epidemiologists, statisticians, psychologists, economists, sociologists, political scientists, computer scientists. . ."
