    "一般情况下 SVI 过程中每次更新的计算复杂度是正比于样本数，所以我们需要是用 mini-batch 的办法减少复杂度。For a model with $N$ observations, running the `model` and `guide` and constructing the ELBO involves evaluating log pdf's whose 计算复杂度随着样本数 $N$ 比例增长. This is a problem if we want to scale to large datasets. 幸运的是，ELBO 目标自然的支持子采样 provided that 我们的 model/guide 具有一些条件独立性结构 that we can take advantage of. 例如, in the case that the observations are conditionally independent given the latents, the log likelihood term in the ELBO can be approximated with\n",
