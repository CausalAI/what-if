This view is especially problematic when interested in sustained treatment strategies: it is often difficult to argue that a per-protocol effect of sustained strategies in a realistic setting measures efficacy, or that the intention-to-treat effect in the presence of uncertainty about the benefits (or harms) of treatment measures the effectiveness after those benefits (or harms) are proven. As a result, the labels “effectiveness” and “efficacy” are ambiguous in settings with sustained strategies over long periods.

    "The similarities between follow-up studies with and without baseline randomization are increasingly apparent in the health and social sciences as a growing number of randomized experiments attempt to estimate the effects of sustained treatment strategies over long periods in real world settings. These studies are a far cry from the short experiments in highly controlled settings that put randomized trials at the top of the hierarchy of study designs in the early days of clinical research. 长期持续治疗策略的随机实验, with their potential for substantial deviations from protocol (e.g., imperfect adherence to the assigned strategy, loss to follow-up), 是受制于混淆和选择偏差 that we have learned to associate exclusively with observational studies. In particular, when estimating a per-protocol effect, both randomized trials and observational studies may need adjustment for time-varying prognostic factors that predict drop-out (selection bias) and treatment (confounding)."

    "In view of these similarities, one might expect that randomized experiments and observational studies would be analyzed similarly, except for the fact that adjustment for baseline confounders is typically necessary in observational studies. In practice, however, the typical analysis of randomized experiments and observational studies differs radically, which is both perplexing and, as we argue below, problematic.\n",

    "鉴于这些相似之处，人们可能希望对随机实验和观察性研究进行类似的分析，只是在观察性研究中通常需要对基线混杂因素进行调整。然而，在实践中，对随机实验和观察性研究的典型分析在根本上是不同的，这既令人困惑，又如我们下面所讨论的那样是有问题的。"

    "In summary, the analysis of randomized trials and observational studies should be similar. If we feel compelled to adjust for time-varying confounding and selection bias in the analysis of observational studies, we should feel equally compelled to adjust for post-randomization confounding and selection bias in the analysis of randomized trials. The only necessary difference between follow-up studies with and without baseline randomization is, precisely, baseline randomization. That is, adjustment for baseline confounding will not be generally required in intention-to-treat analyses of randomized trials. However, adjustment for post-baseline (time-varying) factors will generally be necessary for per-protocol analyses of both randomized trials and observational studies. A unified approach to causal inference for sustained treatment strategies is possible based on the target trial concept and on g-methods.\n",

    "总之，随机试验和观察性研究的分析应相似。如果我们在观察性研究的分析中被迫适应时变的混杂和选择偏见，那么在随机试验的分析中我们也应被迫适应随机化后的混杂和选择偏见。基线随机化与不基线随机化的随访研究之间唯一必要的区别就是基线随机化。也就是说，在随机试验的意向治疗分析中通常不需要调整基线混淆。但是，对于随机试验和观察性研究的每方案分析，通常需要调整基线后（时变）因素。基于目标试验概念和g方法，可以采用统一的方法对持续治疗策略进行因果推理。"

    "Historically, randomized experiments have been considered far superior to observational studies for the purpose of making causal inferences and aiding decision-making. Unfortunately, randomized experiments are not always available because they may be expensive, infeasible, unethical, or simply untimely to support an urgent decision. Therefore, as much as we may like randomization, many decisions will need to be made in the absence of evidence from randomized trials. When we cannot conduct the randomized experiment that would answer our causal question, we resort to observational analyses. It is therefore important to use a sound approach to design and analyze observational studies. Making the target trial explicit is one step in that direction. When the goal is to assist decision making, the analysis of existing observational data need to explicitly emulate a trial and be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate their target trial.\n",

    "从历史上看，出于做出因果推理和辅助决策的目的，随机实验被认为远远优于观察性研究。不幸的是，随机实验并非总是可用，因为它们可能昂贵，不可行，不道德或只是不及时地支持紧急决定。因此，就我们可能希望的随机性而言，在缺乏随机试验证据的情况下，需要做出许多决定。当我们无法进行能够回答因果问题的随机实验时，我们会进行观察性分析。因此，重要的是要采用合理的方法来设计和分析观测研究。明确目标试验是朝这个方向迈出的一步。当目标是协助决策时，需要对现有观察性数据进行分析以明确模拟试验，并就其模拟目标试验的效果进行评估。"
